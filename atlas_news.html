<tr><td>09-feb-2018</td><td>Added SREX masks for temperature observation analysis (thanks Wagner).</td></tr>
<tr><td>07-jan-2018</td><td>For two weeks incorrectly propagated metadata in time series could have caused problems. This should be fixed now.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12-jan-2016</td><td>The storage server from which the Climate Explorer gets its data will be rebooted this day. This may degrade performance a bit.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15-sep-2015</td><td>Question: would RCM data (eg from CORDEX) be useful in the Atlas? Please contact me if you need other data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12-may-2015</td><td>Fixed a bug in the KNMI Climate Change Atlas: time series of some countries could not be computed (thanks Paul).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12-may-2015</td><td>Fixed a bug in the KNMI Climate Change Atlas: RCP4.5/RCP6.0/RCP8.5 combined maps did not plot for the full CMIP5 ensemble (thanks Paul).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>31-jan-2014</td><td>Fixed bug that absolute and relative regression trend maps had the same file name, whichever was computed first would always be shown.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>31-dec-2014</td><td>Added states of the US.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>20-aug-2014</td><td>Removed INMCM4 and IPSL-CM5B-LR from the fd (frost days) ensemble because they have far too many frost days in tropical regions and Europe (thanks Claudia).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>15-aug-2014</td><td>Changed the presentation of differences in extreme variables that count the number of days (frost days, ice days, ...), so that areas with less than one day per year in the current climate stay white (thanks Claudia).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>10-jul-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug in the trends (regressions) where only one percentile plot was shown as the name was not unique across percentiles.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>23-may-2014</td><td>Upgraded CRU TS to version 3.21 (thanks Michael).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>22-may-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug introduced two days ago that prevented time series of seasons being computed (thanks Michael).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>20-may-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug that prevented non-linear trends of annual (extreme) data to be computed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>20-may-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug that prevented time series of relative anomalies annual time series to be computed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>19-may-2014</td><td>Switched to the CCCMA altcdd and altcwd to avoid problems in 2005 and 2006 in almost always dry/wet regions (thanks Slava).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>19-may-2014</td><td>Maps with the combined scenarios RCP4.5/RCP6.0/RCP8.5 now also work for extremes, where it is most useful (thanks Andreas).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>14-may-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug that for time series the scenarios would always be selected if they had once been selected (thanks Albert).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>09-jan-2014</td><td>Changed the way countries are treated: if a region (island) is too small to have a grid point in the interior it contributes proportional to its area. This way small countries still give a result, even though it may not be completely representative of the area of the country itself.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>03-jan-2014</td><td>Added all countries and autonomous regions of the world to the list of predefined regions. Please let me know if you prefer to have sub-categaries like I made for the Netherlands, France.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>22-dec-2013</td><td>Added soil moisture, please note that the reliability is not very high.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>06-dec-2013</td><td>Implemented remembering forms for nonimous users. This shoudl also improve the user experience on tablets and smartphones.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>28-nov-2013</td><td>Added <a href="http://www.cccma.ec.gc.ca/data/climdex/climdex.shtml" target=_new>CCCMA ETCCDI</a> CMIP5 annual extremes, it looks as if I have fixed the bugs, please let me know if you find suspicious results.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>06-nov-2013</td><td>Time series now work well for relative and absolute values as far as I can see. Please disregard results obtained before now.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>06-nov-2013</td><td>Maps did not work for half a day due to a typo.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>01-nov-2013</td><td>I think I got the time series section to work as well. Please report bugs.</td>
