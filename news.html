<tr><td>25-apr-2018</td><td>Fixed a bug that caused the last month of a monthly dataset not to be read if the start date was after the first date of the file. In particular, this caused plots of the difference of last month with a climatology to fail. They now still have variance and p-value undefined, so do not use a cutoff (thanks Evgeny).</td></tr>

<tr><td>04-apr-2018</td><td>Blacklisted IP address 64.62.252.162 for indiscriminately downloading everything. This probably also caused the full disk last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>04-apr-2018</td><td>Due to a full disk the Climate Explorer did not work for about six hours yesterday night until 3AM Dutch summer time.</td></tr>

<tr><td>30-jan-2018</td><td>The daily GHCN-D and ECA&D station data now have metadata, probably not according to the correct "controlled vocabulary" but it is a start. The metadata is embedded in the ascii and netcdf versions of the file, and is displayed in a human-readable format by following the link "metadata" above figures. It is now propagated into most netcdf output, and will eventually be added to the figures as well for complete traceability (as in "how did I exactly make this figure half a year ago?")</td></tr>

<tr><td>24-jan-2017</td><td>Due to demands of journals for data provenance, I have been working to treat metadata better in the Climate Explorer (in code that dates back to the late 1990s when that concept hardly existed). The most-used routines now propagate the input metadata and add their own. In parallel I am also adding relevant metadata to all the data I collect from all over the world, if not already included. In the end this means that the final netcdf or ascii file includes the full information on how it was produced. I am looking for ways to include that in the EPS, PDF and PNG figures. <font color=#FF2222>In the meantime, this transformation sometimes destabilises routines that worked well before.

<tr><td>04-sep-2014</td><td>The GEV(T) routine (trends in extremes) now also works for sets of stations, which are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. This is OK for most summer rainfall observations, but not much else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>01-sep-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug that prevented subtracting the regression of multiple indices from a time series. Not sure this has ever worked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26-aug-2014</td><td>Server has been down for ten minutes to increase the memory from 12 GB to 48 GB, this should make it easier to analyse large datasets and avoid the slowdowns sometimes associated with a largish number of students doing the same exercise.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24-apr-2014</td><td>There was a possibility that your metadata for an uploaded file survived the nightly cleaning script whereas the data itself would not. When someone else re-used the number the metadata pointed to that other file. I added some checking and hope that is enough to kill this problem (thanks William).</td></tr>
<tr><td>24-apr-2014</td><td>The CMIP5 sic (sea-ice concentration) fields were incomplete, re-running the scripts (Thanks Kenneth).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14-apr-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug in the ERA-interim Tmin/Tmax fields. These accidentally only considered the minimum/maximum temperature over 6-12 UTC and 18-24 UTC, not the other half of the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14-apr-2014</td><td>Fixed a big bug in the Berkeley TMIN/TMAX monthly gridded fields, which had the time axis off by four months since 8 March 2014 (thanks Rob).</td></tr>

<tr><td>26-mar-2014</td><td>I think the GEV fit to extremes with trend now also works properly with the "scale" option (adjusting &mu; and &sigma; simultaneously). The numbers were correct but the plot was off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26-mar-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug in reading daily netcdf files if the start year was later than the first year of data (leap year problem). The answer was almost always nonsense, no correlation at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20-mar-2014</td><td>The error in the 0.25&deg; E-OBS fields has been fixed (an old version of nco corrupted the file with more than 2^31 values).</td></tr>

<tr><td>10-feb-2013</td><td>The option in the time-dependent GEV-fit of block maxima (minima) to scale the position and scale parameters simultaneously seems to work now. This option is recommended for large-scale precipitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>05-feb-2013</td><td>The monthly update failed on a full hard disk, which means quite a few files have been corrupted. I am repairing most, please let me know which ones I missed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>09-jan-2013</td><td>Changed the way countries are treated: if a region (island) is too small to have a grid point in the interior it contributes proportional to its area. This way small countries still give a result, even though it may not be completely representative of the area of the country itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>09-jan-2013</td><td>Added a set of 235 countries to the pre-defined masks. Also split up a few countries with overseas parts. Please send me useful subdivisions if you need these.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16-dec-2013</td><td>The 2013 ERA-interim 3D fields have the order of the levels reversed, so that the 850mb level was continued with 300mb etc. Fixed. (Thanks Phil.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-dec-2013</td><td>A typo introduced a month ago (lack of concentration...) meant that netcdf files with a "since" date with days other than one were offset in time. This affected the ERA-interim files (offset 14 months), possibly others (thanks Phil).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22-nov-2013</td><td>Added hurs (relative humidity) to the CMIP5 dataset, put in list instead of huss (specific humidity).</td></tr>

<tr><td>25-jun-2013</td><td>Added the possibility to average fields over irregular region, either pre-defined SREX regions or uploaded by the user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25-jun-2013</td><td>Whoever is teaching a course at 212.205.78.34 in Greece please do NOT use big datasets like CRU TS 3.1, GPCC 0.5&deg;, the server can only handle 2 or 3 of these at the same time, not six.</td><tr>
<tr><td>24-jun-2013</td><td>The zombie bug in the CESM1-CAM5 r3i1p1 data that was squashed more than a year ago has risen from the grave again. I deleted all data from this run until the correct version again replaces the buggy one and is propagated (thanks Kenneth)</td><tr>
<tr><td>20-jun-2013</td><td>Fixed a serious bug in the field filtering routine that wrote Feb 29 in non-leap years as zeroes into the output file (as Mar 1 the first time, Mar 2 the  second, etc). This also meant the output was too long. I hope no-one else was bitten by this one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19-jun-2013</td><td>Updated the field significance routine to include statements for return times and to use a somewhat different way to estimate the decorrelation length which emphasises the signal regions more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19-jun-2013</td><td>Fixed a bug in the running correlation routine: the scatterplot at the end contained the last random sereis from the Monte Carlo significance test rather than real data. Fixed. (thanks Tim).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-jun-2013</td><td>Updated the CMIP5 tos (SST) fields. CSIRO now has -1.8&deg;C under sea ice, I was shown a way to interpolate the CMCC and GFDL fields as well (thanks Enrico), only BNU-ESM is still missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10-jun-2013</td><td>GPCP daily precipitation updated to v1.2, which also brings it up-to-date (thanks Rogier).</td></tr>

<tr><td>23-apr-2013</td><td>Fixed an error in the GPCP land/sea mask, which was not properly checked in the area-averaging routine (thanks Jouni)</td><tr>
<tr><td>16-apr-2013</td><td>The cause of yesterday's crash seems to be a course at ICTP that overwhelmed the server. Please, when using the Climate Explorer for teaching, realise that it only has 6GB of RAM, which gives an upper limit to the number of fields that can be analysed simultaneously. (ten small, low-resolution ones, only two CRU TS 0.5&deg; fields at the same time). It is essential to tell the students not to re-try when the machine is slow, as that will bring it down completely. Contact me for more tips. I have implemented a simple `too busy' check, hope that helps next time.</td></tr>
